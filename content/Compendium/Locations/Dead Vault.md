# Dead Vault
The Dead Vault is a sealed demiplane located within Golarion's molten core that some say can be found thousands of miles below the center of the Windswept Wastes on the continent of Casmaron. Connected to the surface through the Pit of Gormuz, the Dead Vault is the eons-old prison holding the god [[Rovagug]] and his servants. Legends say that should the Rough Beast ever escape the Dead Vault, he will lay waste to all of Golarion.
