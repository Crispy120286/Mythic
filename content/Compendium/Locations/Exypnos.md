# Exypnos Εξυπνος (Intelligent)

Exypnos was a city-state located on the coast of the Posidonios Sea. It was known for its strategic location and its abundant resources, which made it a thriving trade center. The city was built on a hill and was surrounded by walls for protection. It was ruled by a council of nobles, who made decisions based on the will of the people.

Exypnos had a strong army and was known for its military prowess. The city-state was also known for its art and culture, with many famous temples, theaters, and sculptures. The citizens of Exypnos were proud of their heritage and their way of life, and they valued democracy, philosophy, and education.

One unique aspect of Exypnos was that it was home to a powerful group of Wizards called House Colorion, who were highly respected and influential in the city-state. House Colorion used their powers to protect the city from threats, such as enemy armies or natural disasters. They also used their magic to enhance the lives of the citizens, for example by using spells to increase crop yields or heal the sick.

The social hierarchy in Exypnos was similar to other city-states in The Empire, with the wealthy landowners at the top and the peasants at the bottom. However, House Colorion held a special place in society and were often consulted by the rulers on important matters. Slaves were also present in Exypnos, but they had no rights and were treated as property.
