### Description
The College is slightly taller than the surrounding buildings by half a story. It's longer and wider than any other, two Hundred Feet by fifty feet made of the same yellow sandy stone the rest of the city is. The campus extends back to an open firing range and a privacy wall the same height as the rest of the building.

Inside there are ten dedicated classrooms to the schools of magic and thirty dedicated labs for each professor and student. The building extends down below for storage rooms, abandoned spaces, and the Library. The Library is less a collection of tomes and more a wall lined with carved rock that keeps a record of the students, professors, and distinguished donors of the past. Most lessons are by word of mouth.
