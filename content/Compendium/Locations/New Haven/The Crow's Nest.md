# The Crows Nest
[[Baldric]]: Owns the bar and is the Master of the Thieves guild. Literal hole in the wall Bar. Thieves guild front. Open secret. Thieves guild has roughly five members and is a “Steal from not wary enough visitors'' type of guild. Current agreement with [[Zerg]] stops them from stealing from locals under the threat of “Actual rules.” Won’t stop other groups from operating but will report to [[Zerg]] to protect their own interests.
