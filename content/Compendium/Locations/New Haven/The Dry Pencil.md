# The Dry Pencil
Weird shop that sells supplies. Trades for salt and herbs? The proprietor is [[Holge]]. [[Oleg]] is the errand boy and runner.

General Store, 75% chance to have any given mundane equipment in stock.
+10% on all listed prices. No haggling.
The center square market is his only real competition and is unreliable for general goods sales.
