### Summary
Campus Security. Long Blonde hair kept up in a bun, piercing green eyes that seem to look through you. Fast to smile or engage in a competition or game of chance. She wears loose comfortable clothing over a lithe build that allows her to move freely. She uses a Bronze Rapier.

Was captured by the Prophet and infected under the Island. We found her and the Count together.
