### Summary
The Professor of Evocation is by far the busiest with all twenty-three students having been taught by her. She's a small meek sounding woman who is prone to whispering when talking and looking anywhere but at whom she is speaking to. Just under five feet tall with rosy cheeks and frazzled blonde hair. Lavender eyes that betray a bit of non-human ancestry.
