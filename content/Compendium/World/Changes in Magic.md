Magic has changed. It is not like it was. Here are a few of my observations of the world.
### World
1. The island is floating. People have mentioned something called [[Float Stones]] which apparently hold up the islands.
2. The moon is broken, it appears there is a huge chunk taken out of it.

### Spellcasting
1. Prestidigitation does not clean anymore. The rest of the spells abilities seem to work alright. More experimenting is required.
2. Make whole can not restore wear and tear.
3. Most effects that produce food make spoiled food.
4. Conjuration works fine.
5. Arcane magic in general is a bit weaker. This island however, Arcane magic is slightly empowered.
