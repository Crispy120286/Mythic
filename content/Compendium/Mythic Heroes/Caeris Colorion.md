## Biography
###### Background
Caeris Colorion is the son of Count Orpheus Colorion of Exypnos. Born in the year 1301, he is the eldest child and heir to [[House Colorion]]. His father pushed him very hard to learn the arcane arts and sent into the [[Akadimia Mageias]], known by the students as The Academy. Because of this his relationship with his father would become quite strained. As an investor to the Academy, Count Orpheus would be on campus quite often and would always have a hand in Caeris' education. 

At the Academy he always placed top of his class. Alongside his Magical Theory professor, as part of his graduation thesis he developed a new style of casting spells. Caeris theorized that if you adjust the equations you could adjust the spells on the fly, He would call them exploits. This one-day would branch into a completely new class of spellcaster called the Arcanist, but such an unorthodox method received a lot of pushback from the more traditional wizards at the Academy. His thesis was published and the practical passed. He graduated from the Academy at the top of his class in spring of the year 1323. He was 22 years old.

In addition to his studies he was an avid duelist and was a member of the Academy's Dueling Club. Every summer he participated in the Empires Spell Dueling Championships for the past 5 years. Caeris has placed in the top 3 the last three years in the apprentice division but never won first place. This year would be his first year out of the Apprentice League and would be in the Adept League. His Father would be in the Master League. He is hoping to earn the attention of certain military members and earn himself a good placement if he ranks well.

After he graduates his goal is to join the mage military as an officer.

### Pact
Caeris feels a range of emotion, including anger, resentment, betrayal, fear, and a sense of powerlessness.

For many, making a pact with a powerful being is a significant and life-changing decision, one that requires careful consideration and often a willingness to trade something valuable for magical power. However, Caeris was forced into such a pact, he feels robbed of his agency and choice, leading to feelings of resentment and anger towards the entity that forced him into the arrangement.

Additionally, the Caeris feels fearful of the consequences of breaking the pact or not fulfilling his end of the bargain, which could include severe punishments or retribution from the being he have made the pact with. This fear could lead to a sense of powerlessness and a feeling of being trapped in a situation that they did not choose.

Overall, being forced into a pact would likely be a traumatic experience for a Caeris, leading to a range of complex emotions and psychological effects.

Burdened by the knowledge the entity he's sworn to has literally cursed him and there's nothing he can do about it.
