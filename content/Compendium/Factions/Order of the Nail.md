# Order of the Nail
**Symbol** thick nails forming a sunburst  
**Headquarters** 
**Leader** 
**Members** frontiersmen, settlers, victims of barbarian and monster attacks  
**Armor Features** breastplate emblazoned with a fiendish face, horned helm  
**Favored Weapon** lance or halberd  

**Tenants**
- I will strike against civilization’s foes, braving both thicket and darkness.
- I will rid the world of threats to civilization and make it fit for the law to flourish.
- I will fear no creature, though the enemies of order are terrible.
- I will not be merciful, though the enemies of order may bear familiar guises—and may even be individuals I have considered dear.
- I will seek allies and advantage, confounding luck with wisdom.
- I will be the face that monsters dread: fierce, sharp, and unflinching.

# Philosophy
To certain dogmatic, rigid-minded individuals, civilization seems under siege. Beyond the bulwarks of cities and national borders lies an endless expanse of wilderness populated by those who, all too often, shun the rules of settled, lawful societies and follow their own callings. To the Order of the Nail, these beings enviously prey upon the children of the law, seeking to draw civilization into a regressive mire. The Order of the Nail stands staunchly against what it views as barbarity.
