# To-Do List
Take all resources from the islands.

Do testing on Float Stones. Find barren islands and take the float stones for research. Need a sizeable amount for research. 

Teleport back to New Haven with a team to try and recover the floatstone research there.

How much mass can a floatstone hold? Is it determined by the mass of the floatstone?

Start with 1 flying defense tower. Build a total of 5 or 8 of them

Aesthetically I would prefer 8 of them to symbolize all 8 schools of magic.
