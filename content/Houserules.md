# Building Rules
As a small disclaimer this will not represent the kingdom building rules in their completed state. As of now this is only the part where we are making things and researching things.

Build points (BP) represent physical rescourses such as wood, stone, metal, food, and water.
One BP is equivalent to five thousand gold pieces.

Spending build points requires manpower.
One Hundred people can produce one Manpower. 
Manpower is also used to "harvest" BP but the exchange rate will vary depending on the rescourses available and technology used to harvest said rescource.

One manpower can expend one BP in one week.
Therefore one average nameless NPC can produce 50gp of value a week on any given project assuming normal circumstances. 

Manpower and BP can also be used to research things. This can be magical rituals, improving harvesting methods, and technology.
Research requires skill checks somewhat related to what is being researched, craft and profession checks being the most common.
The skill check is made by a head researcher once a week and can be modified by other skilled assistants. A head researcher can manage one skilled assistant per level. Skill checks made will be on a weekly basis.
Skill checks for research are made after a week's worth of time is put in.

I don't have a strong need to track amounts of specific rescources, thats what BPs are for. But if you don't have access to a needed material you can't build something that requires it.  
For example If you want to make steel weapons, you need the forge, the carbon, the metal, and the tools. All of which may require research to get it to a workable state or be grouped into the steel making process.
