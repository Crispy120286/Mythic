# Caeris Colorion the First
He was a hero in his age. Powerful Wizard. He unfortunately had a string of bad defeats towards the end of his adventuring career. His compantions dead or lost, the love of his life magically imprisoned. Knowing all was lost he teleported to a new land with his young child and started his life over. He was never able to rescue the love of his life from her fate but was able to set her soul free to recieve Pharasma's judgement.

He founded the Colorion line in a new land which he called [[Exypnos]] ("Clever" in the old tongue). His son would marry and have two childred who would live on to continue the Colorion lineage. He began using the riches from his adventuring career to fund arcane schools and to spread knowledge and history. This became the legacy of [[House Colorion]].

Towards the end of his life he began looking to secure his legacy. Having forsaken necromancy he never looked into extending his life. He began to rely heavy on divinations and time magic and look towards the future and eventually set his gaze upon Chronus himself. Through Chronus he seen that Rovagug would break free from his prison and that a Colorion would be there. This vision would cost Caeris his sight for the rest of his life. He knew he would be long passed when this happens so he would pass down this warning with his heirs and set in motion plans to help his heirs when it eventually happens.

He would eventually pass in his sleep at the age of 95, never forgetting his old companions or his first love. To the end he believed he let them down and was the cause of their demise.

The warning eventually became a prophecy. A family legend of ages past.

> A day will come when they come out of the earth to drag down in their talons the remains of a war-exhausted mankind. A day when the lands shall sink and the dark depths of the world shall ascent amidst universal pandemonium.

# 1,000+ Years Later
[[Caeris Colorion]] is the son of Count Orpheus Colorion of Expynos. Born in the year 1301, he is the eldest child and heir to [[House Colorion]]. His father pushed him very hard to learn the arcane arts and sent into the [[Akadimia Mageias]], known by the students as The Academy. Because of this his relationship with his father would become quite strained. As an investor to the Academy, Count Orpheus would be on campus quite often and would always have a hand in Caeris' education. 

At the Academy he always placed top of his class. Alongside his Magical Theory professor, as part of his graduation thesis he developed a new style of casting spells. Caeris theorized that if you adjust the equations you could adjust the spells on the fly, He would call these, exploits. This would one-day branch into a completely new class of spellcaster called the Arcanist, but such an unorthodox method recieved a lot of pushback from the more traditional wizards at the Academy. His thesis published and the practical passed  He graduated the Academy at the top of his class in spring of the year 1323.

In addition to his studies he was an avid duelist and was a member of the Academy's Dueling Club. Ever summer he participated in the Empires Spell Dueling Championships for the past 5 years. Caeris has placed in the top 3 the last three years in the apprentice division but never won first place. This year would be his first year out of the Apprentice League and would be in the Adept League. His Father would be in the Master League. He is hoping to earn the attention of certain military members and earned himself a good placement if he ranks well.

### Five stages of grief in relation to Caeris Colorion's situation.

The five stages of grief are:

Denial - the first stage, where the individual refuses to accept the reality of the situation. In Caeris' case, he may initially believe that he is still in his own time and that everything around him has changed.

Anger - the second stage, where the individual may experience feelings of anger and frustration at the situation. In Caeris' case, he may feel angry at the people or circumstances that have brought him to the future, or at himself for not being able to return to his own time.

Bargaining - the third stage, where the individual may try to make deals or bargains in an attempt to change the situation. In Caeris' case, he may try to find ways to return to his own time, or bargain with the people in the future to help him.

Depression - the fourth stage, where the individual may feel a deep sense of sadness or hopelessness at the situation. In Caeris' case, he may feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the changes that have occurred, and mourn the loss of everything he once knew.

Acceptance - the final stage, where the individual comes to terms with the reality of the situation and begins to move forward. In Caeris' case, he may come to accept that he cannot return to his own time, and begin to explore and adapt to the new world around him.

It is important to note that not everyone experiences these stages in the same order or with the same intensity, and some people may not experience all of the stages at all. The grieving process is unique to each individual and their specific circumstances.

### Soliloquy
"I am Caeris Colorion, a wizard from the past. A life that once held such promise, now lies in ruin. I am trapped in this unfamiliar world, unable to comprehend the enormity of the changes that have occurred. The Deity has brought me here, cursing me with his power, making me his puppet, and stripping me of my free will.

Anger boils within me, fueled by the resentment I feel towards this entity that has forced me into this pact. My rage is only surpassed by the sense of betrayal I feel. I never chose this fate, but now I am powerless to escape it.

My fear is overwhelming. The threat of punishment and retribution from this being I have made this pact with looms over me. I am a mere pawn in its game, with no say in my own destiny. I am trapped, and the weight of this knowledge crushes me.

I mourn the loss of everything I once knew, and the people I have left behind. I am alone in this new world, a stranger in a strange land. This curse has taken everything from me, and yet I am still bound by it.

I do not know what the future holds for me, but I know that I will fight. I will fight against the power that has cursed me, and I will fight to regain my freedom. I will not be a mere pawn in this game, but will take control of my own destiny. The Deity may have brought me here, but I will not allow it to break me. I am Caeris Colorion, and I will not be defeated."

### Monologue to Chronus
My life, a life that once held such promise, now lies in ruin. You trapped me in this unfamiliar world, I can not even begin to comprehend the enormity of the changes that have occurred. You have brought me here, and now you want to curse me with his power, making me your puppet, and stripping me of my free will.

Anger boils within me, fueled by the resentment I feel towards you. You forced me into this pact! My rage is only surpassed by the sense of betrayal I feel. I never chose this fate, but now I am powerless to escape it.

I mourn the loss of everything I once knew, and the people I have left behind. I am alone in this new world, a stranger in a strange land. This curse has taken everything from me, and yet I am still bound by it.

Deity, I stand before you, scared and trembling at the power you hold over me. You forced me into this pact against my will, and I have been suffering ever since. I am a mere pawn in your game, with no say in my own destiny. I am trapped, and the weight of this knowledge crushes me.

I demand answers from you. Why did you force me into this pact? What do you want from me? And why must I suffer the consequences of your power without any say in the matter?

I do not know what the future holds for me, but I know that I cannot deny the power that you have given me. However, I refuse to be your puppet, bound to your will without any say in the matter. I will use this power on my own terms, for my own purposes, and I will not allow you to control me.

Although I am angry at the circumstances that brought me here, and resentful of the fact that I was forced into this pact, I will not let those emotions define me. Instead, I will rise above them, and use this power to carve out my own destiny.

You may have brought me here, but you cannot break me. I am Caeris Colorion, and I will not be defeated. I accept the power you have given me, but I will use it on my own terms, to reclaim my freedom and my agency. I am not your pawn, and I will not be used to simply further your own agenda. I will fight, and I will emerge victorious."

### Monologue edited.
Here's the edited version:

"I, Caeris Colorion, once wielded the powers of magic with great promise, but now find myself in ruin, trapped in this unfamiliar world with no comprehension of its enormity. You, mighty deity, brought me here against my will, and now seek to curse me with a power that would turn me into your puppet, stripping me of my free will.

My anger and resentment towards you boil within me. You forced me into this pact without my consent, leaving me with a sense of betrayal and a fate that I never chose. Yet, I am powerless to escape it.

I mourn the loss of all that I held dear, the people I have left behind. I am now a stranger in a strange land, where everything I once knew is gone, and this curse has taken everything from me. Still, I am bound by it.

I stand before you, trembling in fear, as you hold the power over me. I have been suffering since you forced me into this pact, and I am nothing but a mere pawn in your game, with no control over my own destiny. This knowledge crushes me, and I demand answers from you.

Why did you force me into this pact? What do you want from me? Why must I suffer the consequences of your power without my say in the matter?

**Wait for answers**

I acknowledge the power that you have given me, but I refuse to be your puppet, bound to your will without any say. I will use this power on my own terms, for my own purposes, and I will not allow you to control me.

Though I am resentful of the circumstances that brought me here, I will not let them define me. Instead, I will rise above them and carve out my own destiny. I accept the power that you have given me, but I will use it on my own terms to reclaim my freedom and agency.

I am not your pawn, and I will not further your agenda. I am Caeris Colorion, a wizard, and I will not be defeated. I will fight for my freedom, and I will emerge victorious."
