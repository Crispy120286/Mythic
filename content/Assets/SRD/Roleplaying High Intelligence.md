> "Keep copious notes, and convince the GM to let you refer to them in out-of-game time. A good GM will provide you with more information than the other players might have, in order to spur you along somewhat."

"There are a couple of strategies that come to mind. They represent a strategy of behaving like an intelligent character would, and trusting the game master to represent that in the world

1.  Remember that an intelligent character will want more facts to make decisions with, so concentrate your efforts on collecting data, and them make an informed decision.
2.  Play tactfully. An intelligent character will avoid burning bridges.
3.  It's better to keep your mouth closed and be thought a fool than to open it and remove all doubt. Don't do obviously stupid things. Everyone even intelligent characters make mistakes, but drinking the cup of fluid on the altar because you are thirsty is beyond a mistake.
4.  Concentrate on coming up with eccentric, or clever solutions to problems. At the very least ask the GM about the potential of various things in your surroundings. These may spark the GM to give you the core of a plan.

Beyond these and other "smart people" behaviors, it's up to the GM to provide you with the epiphanies that your character would have, now that you have laid the ground work to have them."

Excellent Info!:

"I would recommend breaking the concept of "intelligence" up into specific faculties which are easier to model individually. As a rough list, I would expect an intelligent character to have: A good memory, a broad base of knowledge about the world around them, good analytical skills, and an active imagination.

1) A good memory can be modeled by taking notes. Choose a method that is the least taxing for you, the player, whether that's taking notes or recording the session (if the other players are cool with it). My recommendation is to avoid long form notes because they're of low reference value.

2) A broad base of knowledge can be handled through two methods. One is to take lots of knowledge skills, and to ask for checks on those skills whenever you think they might be relevant. The second is to talk with the DM, and as another poster mentioned, see if they will allow you to assert your character's knowledge by making up minor or interesting details about the world.

3) Good analytical skills means the ability to break things down into smaller pieces and to see how they fit together. IRL, people who face the kinds of high-stress life-or-death situations that PCs face are trained to follow certain models of thought that compress this process. Studying some of these models will help you to evaluate problems. Here are two simple models:

OODA - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. This is the decision process taught to fighter pilots. It involves four steps which cycle, one after the other. [http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/leadership/ooda.html](http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/leadership/ooda.html)

Draw, See, Think, Plan. This involves asking and answering four questions:

What does the state I want to be in look like? How does it differ from the state I am in? What specifically must happen to get me from my current state to my ideal state? What resources do I need to get there?

There are tons more of these heuristics you can find for yourself. These are very basic ones, but they give you basic ideas of how to break down complex problems in manageable components. SWOT analysis and SMART goals may also be useful for longer term plans for the character.

4) An active imagination - This is the most difficult to model without having. One simple way to use your imagination well is whenever you find yourself limited or constrained, ask yourself why that limit or constraint exists, and what it would take for the limitation to be true or not. Then gather information about the situation and decide whether the limitation actually exists. This is very similar to DSTP up above.

For example, if you won't attack the evil mastermind because his bodyguards will kill you, ask yourself why and how they will. What would it take for them not to kill you in a fight? e.g. they are only armed with melee weapons so if you could keep them at range you would be fine. What would be needed for them not to close to melee range with you? etc.

These are all ersatz intelligence at best, but they'll help you model the thought processes of a highly intelligent character."

"Depends on time commitment and the style of campaign. I'm going to assume that you're willing to devote some out-of-game time to game preparation and that roleplaying is a major focus of the group (as opposed to combat or world-building or something like that).

1. Intelligent people in societies with writing tend to read and write a lot. This is honestly really important. A lot of people seem intelligent merely because they have a vast pool of knowledge to draw from, gained both by memorized knowledge and an understanding of how to use research methods to find the right answer quickly.

You can portray this in-character fairly easily by depicting your character spending time reading, or reciting poetry or whatever is the most common method of passing knowledge from one person to another in the setting. Reading isn't just restricted to wizards. Fighters with a high int might do so too. And the material doesn't even have to be something related to their class--it could just be general knowledge. Have your character spend time writing too, not just consuming knowledge. Maybe they spend some time describing the anatomy of monsters recently fought, or simply summarizing the events of a particular harrowing adventure next time the party has some down time.

You can portray this out-of-character by doing the same; reading setting materials, summarizing them in your own words, and keeping the notes with you. Maybe take some in-setting history and summarize it in (simple) long-format poetry. Even if it's not very good that still usable. Have your character quote relevant portions at times.

2. Intelligent people aren't always right, or have perfect knowledge. A lot of people who seem intelligent are merely confident in their answers. This confidence might well be misplaced. If you want to play a character that seems intelligent, all you really have to do is make some knowledge checks, use the resulting information to come up with a plan of action, then defend that solution. Even if you aren't necessarily right--even if the DM does not 'cheat' for you--you can still seem intelligent if you pull it off right. This is one of the areas of nebulous difference between intelligence and wisdom. A wise character might well simply be someone more willing to spend more time considering options or evaluating the opinions of others.

3. Intelligent people tend to pay attention to the world around them. While it's not perfectly true (absent-minded professor types with high int, low wis, for example), it's generally true that intelligent folks try to learn from the world around them. Have your character do the same. When they make mistakes, have them spend time afterwards trying to figure out how it could have been done better. This is not the same as spotting hidden dangers or concealed ambushes or whatever--it's just an outward focus.

4. It's hard to portray intelligence without goals and opinions. Have your character develop some of them. They don't have to be world-shattering ruthless-acquisition-of-power type goals. Maybe it's as simple as trying to figure out an easier way to do something to avoid work. These goals should also be comprised of some long-term goals and a rotating set of short-term goals. While this is easily interpreted as a suggestion that all intelligent characters be driven and ambitious, that's not the intent here.

5. Don't sell yourself short. For the most part (disorders aside), people have basically the same mental hardware and intellectual capacity. The main difference between people who seem intelligent and people who seem dim comes down to how that hardware gets used. Have your character spend time considering his actions and how to best achieve his objectives. This is as true of fighters, rogues, clerics, etc as it is for stereotypical high-int wizards. Rich Burlew does a great job of portraying a high-int fighter in Order of the Stick, for example. Spend time thinking actions through, considering consequences, etc."

A character with a High Intelligence but Low Wisdom might be incredibly book smart, but continually makes poor decisions, is absent-minded in the extreme, and tends to miss "little picture" stuff in favor of "big picture" stuff. This is the incredibly learned wizard who basically needs a handler wherever he goes due to his eccentricity. One example might be Walter Bishop from the TV show Fringe, if that makes sense.

character with high Intelligence but low Wisdom may be smart but absentminded, or knowledgeable but lacking in common sense...

Absent-minded professor is one high INT low WIS archetype. This is the person who is brilliant but struggles in the real world because of lack of savvy or common sense. The kind of person about whom people say,"He's so smart, I can't believe he puts his pants on backwards." Or perhaps the intellectual who is oblivious to the world around him because his head is always buried in a book. Or perhaps someone who is mildly or moderately autistic, extremely intelligent but imperceptive because he is lives in his own insular world. Another might be an arrogant intellectual who is oblivious to the world around him because he is so self-absorbed and caught up in his feelings of superiority. Religious or political fanatic is another possibility, someone highly intelligent but extremely pig-headed and narrow-minded, too small-minded to see any points of view but his own.

More book learning and logic than common sense.

Wisdom is the ability to learn from your mistakes and experiences in the world (thus the perception connection). An unwise character is one who will ignore reality or be oblivious to it, and be similarly oblivious to consequences.

Paired with a high INT, this obliviousness is likely to manifest as a preoccupation with working out some problem, and when reality comes knocking, it is perceived as an interruption. The most expedient method of stopping the interruption will be taken so he can get back to his thoughts.

I've seen a high INT roleplayed a few different ways, and it depends on the other mental stats.

Booksmart- This is the "Knowledge" skill style player, the typical wizard. Knows 'About" things, but not necessarily clever, or social. This is a High INT, Low WIS, low CHA.

Strategist- This is cleverness, the ability to put into action whatever it is you know, be it a lot or a little. This is High INT, High WIS.

Street Smart- This is more of a social intelligence, making descisions based upon the effects and reactions of others. this is High INT, High CHA.
