# Contract
- I have my familiar help decipher the contract on my body. 

>Linguistics Check Roll: **35**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **28**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **18**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **37**
>Total Roll: **118**

- Rolls for the downtime week.

>Linguistics Check Roll: **28**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **18**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **30**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **22**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **26**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **15**
>Linguistics Check Roll: **20**
>Total Roll: **+159**(**277**)

The contract languages is a combination of Infernal, Celestial, and a dialect of Primordial. The words are purposefully overlapping and are moving. Chronus is a dick.

- We should have a year or so before the next events.

>Linguistics Check Roll: +5702 over the course of 33 weeks. (While searching for a home)

>Research Paper +50. (**6029**)

- Over the course of research. The letters do definitely move. they also come in and our depending on time of day and day pf the year? While I have translated a number of the phrases, it seems to be very gibberish, grammar doesn't apply but there is some sense to it.
- On my birthday I learn the name of who I am bound to... Chronus.
