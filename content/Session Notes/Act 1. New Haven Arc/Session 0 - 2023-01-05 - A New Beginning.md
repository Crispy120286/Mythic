# Things to bring up during Session 0
0. [ ] Go over my Build
1. [ ] When we get powerful enough to have our own separate nations, I want us to make separate other non-mythic characters to be the advisors to the mythic character. For example, When I have a quest for myself in his own nation that doesnt involve the others, Koda and Tony will roll up two non mythic characters who will aid him for adventures specifically involving his nation only. same for the other two	
2. [ ] Fun island ideas:
	1. [ ] Secluded island that is stuck in stone age. has myths about the "edge of the world".
	2. [ ] Wild Magic island.
	3. [ ] Island made entirely out of crystal that came from deep within the planet.
	4. [ ] Large grouping of island all interconnected by chains to keep them together.
	5. [ ] Not an island at all, but a massive airship city like a cruise ship. Out of fuel mission?
	6. [ ] Quarantine Island. Plague of zombies or something. Island slowling coming closer. collission inevitable.
	7. [ ] dragonisles. Where Raleigh and melody are. O.G. Raleigh was a Dragon-person-thing.
3. [ ] What is the most common knowledge of the world that even peasants know?
4. [ ] What is the name of the starting Island?
5. [ ] What is the name of the starting city?
6. [ ] What’s the accessibility of magic and general level of technology?
7. [ ] What are the primary adventuring environments?
8. [ ] What are the major threats and main story themes?
9. [ ] **Death** - What happens when a PC dies? What happens when there is a TPK? Does the game end? Does it mean that time passes & events progress a certain number of years before the players can create new PCs? Should every player have a backup character ready to go?
10. [ ] **Resurrection** - What options, in the setting or in the game, do players have for resurrecting fallen PCs? Is this the privy of high-level PCs & Gods, or can anyone bring the corpse of a fallen ally to the resurrection temple & pay a huge sum of money to resurrect a character? Do you have an alternate set of Resurrection rules. Did you pick up the rule-set that Mat Mercer recently refined for his PC resurrections? Even if you follow resurrection RAW, what impact does resurrection have in-game? Is this a common occurrence in this setting? or is it something special & unique? Will characters be expected to go get a special Mcguffin (like unicorn blood, angel tears, phoenix down) otherwise resurrection spells will automatically fail?
11. [ ] How much of a sandbox the game will be?
12. [ ] Can we take a drawback so we can take an additional trait?
13. [ ] Leadership feat.
14. [ ] What are your [[Houserules]]
15. [ ] Mythic ability Eldrich Breach. Can this work for Counterspells? Specifically when I have to roll a caster level check to counter a spell. Current ruling is yes, but discuss.
17. [ ] as per our discussions, I would graduate from the Academy in the year 1323. The same year as the cataclysm.

Game Begin!

[[Kian Volusius]]- My rival in the [[Akadimia Mageias]]

I am set to duel him for the Colorion family honor.

My father comes into the room and Tells me that as heir to the Colorion line, It is my duty to lead the family. He then bestows upon me the Colorion family book. The [[Book of Colorion]]. It is a Blessed Book. I have dreamed of this for many years.

The bell tolls and I head out to the dueling arena where I face off against my opponent.

The earth cracks open, a massive tentacle reaches out and an eye opens and looks around. Its terrifying. more reach up and slam into the ground and start rending the area apart.

I immediately cast Mage Armor and Shield, then i turn to run towards my family. Something grabbed my leg and pulled me down into the deeps. As i'm falling i notice the Colorion book falling.

I wake in a strange forest. I hear creatures all around me. I see a shack in the distance. I run towards it and one of the monsters chase me. A big thing with claws. I get to the shack and slam the door closed. It starts breaking down the door. In the back is another door.

> Beyond here lies safety.

As I touch it another sentence appears.

> Enter here to enter my service.

It appears that I am to be bound by some contract or die to this monster thing. Something catches my eye. A small silver orb with a single golden object floating around it. It floats over to the door and appears to look at it and then me. I took my chances and we jumped through.

Falling again. I hit the ground hard and I'm bleeding. Everything is foggy. I see a figure walking towards me. very large. I try and crawl away but it speaks to me the language I do not understand. He hits me on the side of the head and everything goes black...
