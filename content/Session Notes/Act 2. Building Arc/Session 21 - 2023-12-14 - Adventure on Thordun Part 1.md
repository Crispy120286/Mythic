# Journal
## Gozran 8, 2348. Week 38, [[Thordun]]
We're at [[Thordun]].

[[Victor Kasune|Victor]] scouting, he gets captured. We sense he is in danger and move in.

We go in. They fire upon our ships with their own warships.

### Off Screen
Victor has a one on one with Unnamed [[Stray Deity of War and Strategy]]

We sail down in a dingy. It is the dead of night. And we crash. damnit.

The hobgoblins there are members of the [[Order of the Nail]]. they want to bring the savage lands into civilization. Lawful Evil.

I cast Ashen Path on [[Voltaire]], [[Sigmund Ragehammer|Sigmund]], and Myself.

We retreat then send our scouts in to search the island.

My scout team lead by a half-elf Bard named [[Lysander Ravensong]]. He is incredibly good at what he is doing.
